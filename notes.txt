./run_optimize.sh [name] # run on each to get parameters in DB

./run_best_hyperparameters.sh [name] # generate jsons

./run_eval[n].sh # save mature policies and print hyperparameters with best performance

./run_render[n].sh # generate saved gifs

./run_render_optimization.sh # generates gifs from policeis logged during optimization if something weird happens


For new runs:
Change DB name
Change mature saving treshhold
Change env in evaluation, rendering and training files
Change neural networks (bird flocking)
Change number of steps




Future:
Pick mature threshold based on performance
Change DB name
